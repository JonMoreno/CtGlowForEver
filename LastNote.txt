Testing direct injection into componet property instead of ajax request.
... loading icon possible removal?
... test faster render after???

Re-configure the way we are fetching all the medications by the medical id. 
Index and show method may need alteration where the index method in controller could have the id already assigned the model->id
instead of having to retrieve it from the front end...
Try out front end alternative after...


12/10/2017
Re-design MedicalRecordController to be a simple controller. Program DbMedicalRecordRepository to
fetch all the required data by MedicalRecordController.
To be decided...
Wether DbMedicalRecordRepository will use __constructor to inject all needed Models..

At this point we are validating the first facial form field:
	Scenario:
	Php which is the backend return a 1 for True and 0 for False:
	JS which is the frontEnd will only balidate a boolean if the 
		value is true or false not 1 or 0.
	Solution:
	Find a way to medigate between the back end and front end distinction
	of BOOLEAN values is order to validate the form using the validatio.js 
Thanks!

At this point we are using pagination to retrieve a smaller amount of clients 
for the client list.
	1. Figure out pagination and trigger retrieve more clients up scroll.
	2. Once that is done create a way for the dropdown form to reload client 
		list upon successfull form of new client.

t:001
: configure client search bar: 
	-must either go in the list-comp , or root-comp.
	-If it goes in the root comp, try re-structure.
t:002
: configure back-end for new client created via the dropdown form.
	-when client is created this way no medical model exists in the 
	 DB therefore exception is thrown.

Stay Coding JonNathan! 
Is your gift to this world!
